About
=====
This repository contains simple implementations of the Spherical Grid Treecode algorithm for electrostatics.  The codes are currently pilot implementations, with an emphasis on showcasing the algorithm instead of achieving optimal performance.

License
=======
All codes in this repo are available under the highly permissive MIT license, to encourage further development of this algorithm.  Submissions of new implementations back to this repository are welcome, and the same MIT license would be applied.

Prerequisites
=============
The various codes make references to a sphere set folder named `SS31-Mar-2016`.
Because of the fairly large file size, and to properly credit the original
creator, we recommend obtaining that folder of spherical t-designs from [Rob
Womersley's
website](https://web.maths.unsw.edu.au/~rsw/Sphere/EffSphDes/index.html),
specifically [this
link](https://web.maths.unsw.edu.au/~rsw/Sphere/Points/SS/SS31-Mar-2016.zip).
